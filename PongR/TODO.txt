Rethink the clients in terms of percent: when i update the ball position, I have to think in terms of % and not pixel.
For every step I need to increment the X and Y by 1%, and 1% is 5 pixel, then i finally increment x and y by 5 pixel.
This way I can have a consistent simulation both on the server and the clients, disregard their screen dimension.
Clients and server communicate in terms of %, internally they think in terms of pixel!

Reference field dimension on the server = 1000 (width) * 600 (height) px
So everything should be expressed in terms of percentage: 

Ball -> radius = 20px ==> (20/1000) * 100 = 2%
	 -> center coordinates (50,50) , in the middle of the field
	 -> fixed step = 10 px ==> (5/1000) * 100 = 1%

Player 1 -> BAR_SCROLL_UNIT = 5px ==> (5/600) * 100 = 1%
		 -> bar height = 16% ==>  x:600 = 16:100 => x = (16*600) / 100 ==> height = 96px
		 -> bar width = 3% ==> width = 30 px 
		 -> BarMarginTop = 42% (50 - (height/2)) = 252px
		 -> TopLeftVertex = 5% gap from left delimiter ==> 50px;


Check what must be changed in the physics server loop now that I modified the Player internal status
