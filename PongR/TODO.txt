Rethink the clients in terms of percent: when i update the ball position, I have to think in terms of % and not pixel.
For every step I need to increment the X and Y by 1%, and 1% is 5 pixel, then i finally increment x and y by 5 pixel.
This way I can have a consistent simulation both on the server and the clients, disregard their screen dimension.
Clients and server communicate in terms of %, internally they think in terms of pixel!

Reference field dimension on the server = 1000 (width) * 600 (height) px
So everything should be expressed in terms of percentage: 

Fixed gap -> 30px ==> (30/600) * 100 = 5%

Ball -> radius = 10px ==> (20/1000) * 100 = 1%
	 -> center coordinates (50,50) , in the middle of the field
	 -> fixed step = 10 px ==> (5/1000) * 100 = 1%

Player 1 -> BAR_SCROLL_UNIT = 5px ==> (5/600) * 100 = 1%
		 -> bar height = 16% ==>  x:600 = 16:100 => x = (16*600) / 100 ==> height = 96px
		 -> bar width = 3% ==> width = 30 px 
		 -> BarMarginTop = 42% (50 - (height/2)) = 252px
		 -> TopLeftVertex = 5% gap from left delimiter ==> 50px;



--------------------------------------------------

- Compute latency from client to server and adjust the pause after goal based on the latency
- Write unit tests for the Models
- Write unit tests for the modified keyboard.js 
- Buffer inputs if we the client keeps the button pressed

Performance improvements

- Canvas: (see http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/performance/)
	- group together players drawing into one call
	- apply bounding boxes for all objects on-screen, so that we don't do a clearRect at the beginning of each frame,
	but we clear only the bounding boxes and then we redraw only the items that changed
	- For the icons of the bonuses, use pre-render technique
	- Use 3 layers: one for the background (the field, that can be rendered at a slower rate), 
	one middlelayer for bonuses (also drawn at a slower rate), and one for the foreground (the players and the ball)
